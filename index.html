        <h2>About me</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>I am a relatively young aspiring web dev. I have learnt many languages (most of them front-end), and I hope to utilize them someday for a good cause.
          I grew up in India, where coding was not really <i>encouraged</i>, but rather scoffed upon. So you can imagine that my view of coding was rather biased and one-sided.</p>
