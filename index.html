            <hr>
            <p>Hi, I am <del>Devansh Patil</del> subtra3t. I am known as subtra3t to the internet, a name which whatsoever has no relation
            with me or my personality; it just sounded good.
            </p>
            <p>Okay, so enough with the introductions. I started coding this site on 19 October 2020 (Monday), and published site
             at <a href="https://pages.github.io" target="_blank">Gihub Pages</a> (which is free, if you want to check it out) at **insert time here**.
            This is my site for all my philosophical reflections, meaningless projects too bad for Github, and assignments that have
            to be uploaded to the Net for [not] careful evaluation.
